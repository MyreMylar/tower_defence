# The collision functions in this file are intended to detect collision, or overlaps, between two shapes.
# They currently just return True, in the case of an overlap, or False, in the case of no overlap.
# The polygon polygon function also stores a MTV (minimum translation vector) which should be the minimum
# vector to translate either shape by to undo the collision.

# TODO: create better, MTV-like, calculations for other collision functions
